# JavascriptQuiz

This weeks project was to creat a Javascript quiz

Upon opening the page it will tell you the basic rules of the quiz such as to answer the questions all the questions correctly
and dont run out of time! Getting a question wrong then will cause your timer to be deducted by 5 seconds. 

The quiz will end if you run out of time, upon completion you'll be shown your score and then the scoreboard
of your score and a restart the quiz button as well. 

Unfortunately the timer has given me much trouble this week and I couldn't produce a timer to not only deduct the 5 seconds upon
missing a question, I somehow recreated an additional timer to clock within the original timer.
